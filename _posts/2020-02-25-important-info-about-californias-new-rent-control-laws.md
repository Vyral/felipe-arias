As of January 1, 2020, new rent control laws have taken effect in California. If you’re a landlord, this means that you can no longer increase your rent at whatever rate you want. You are now capped at a 5% maximum yearly increase, which ends up to be a 7% to 7.5% increase on a lease agreement due to inflation. It’s also more difficult to evict tenants because of these changes. There are some exceptions to this rule, such as if your property is less than 15 years old or if it’s a duplex where you live in one unit and rent out their other.&nbsp;
