As we move into spring, it’s time for an update on how our San Diego County market has developed so far this year. 

For one thing, we’re beginning to notice signs of a shift. There was a 9.5% increase in the number of properties hitting the market between January of 2018 and January of this year. Over that same period, the number of sales dropped by 26.2%.

**What does all of this mean?**

First, it means that buyers now have more options than in the recent past. With more homes available in general, and homes spending more time on the market, buyers are in a very favorable position. 

However, at 2.1 months’ worth of supply, we’re still technically in a seller’s market. This means sellers, too, can leverage our market conditions to their advantage. 

The bottom line is that it’s a great time to pursue your real estate goals, whatever they may be, and **our team would be happy to help.**

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
