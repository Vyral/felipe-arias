There are two main methods that investors use when it comes to real estate: Short-term rentals and long-term rentals. Today I’m here to go over the pros and cons of each.

**Long-term rentals are really easy to fill.** Just put an ad out there online, interview five or six potential tenants, run their credit, do a background check, and you can lock them in for a one-year, two-year, or three-year agreement. The only thing you really have to worry about here is some yearly maintenance and you don’t have to furnish it at all.

**With short-term rentals, the ROI is much higher because of increased rates, but the type of management you’ll need involves a lot more work and is more time-consuming.** Airbnb and VRBO can help you market these properties, but you’re still responsible for the turnover.&nbsp;

Another pro for short-term rentals is that the property has less wear and tear. They won’t be drilling holes in the wall or using the appliances every day. However, **they are harder to fill on a daily, monthly, or weekly basis.**

If you have any questions for me about either type of rental investment or anything else related to real estate, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
