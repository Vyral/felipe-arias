Many buyers assume that putting 20% down on a home is their only option, but this isn’t the case. The truth is that there are many down payment options out there, including the FHA loan—which allows buyers to put down as little as 3.5%. The main drawback to this is that when you submit less than 20% down, you’ll be subject to paying mortgage insurance on top of your monthly payments. That is, unless you make use of a VA loan—which allows veterans to purchase property with zero money down. Qualifying non-veterans can also put zero money down by using a down payment assistance program, so connect with a lender as soon as possible if you’re curious which option is best for you. If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
