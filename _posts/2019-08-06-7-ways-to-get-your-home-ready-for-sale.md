Before you put your home up for sale, there are a few steps you’ll need to take first. Here are seven of the most critical:&nbsp;

* **Declutter.** Clearing out junk from your home will make it look cleaner and more spacious, which will give buyers a much better impression. When it comes to the items in your home while it’s open for showings, less is more.&nbsp;
* **Check your light fixtures.** If any bulbs are broken or burnt out, now is the time to replace them. Your home should be impeccably bright while it’s up for sale.&nbsp;
* **Hire a handyman.** You don’t need to go overboard with home repairs, but you should take care of any issues you’ve been putting off. The goal is to preemptively resolve any problems that would otherwise show up on an inspection report later on.&nbsp;

* **Touch up interior and exterior paint.** Giving your home a fresh coat of paint, inside and out, can totally transform its appearance.&nbsp;
* **Hire professional cleaners.** Buyers will be keeping an eye out for even the smallest speck of dust as they tour your home during showings and open houses, so hiring a professional to clean your home before you list is a must.&nbsp;
* **Depersonalize.** Take down family photos, remove any sports paraphernalia, and store religious items while your home is on the market. As much as you cherish these things, they could make it difficult for buyers to imagine themselves living in your property. They want to see your listing as their future home—not your current one.&nbsp;
* **Stage.** Studies show that staged homes tend to sell faster and for more money. Professional staging shows buyers your property’s potential.
