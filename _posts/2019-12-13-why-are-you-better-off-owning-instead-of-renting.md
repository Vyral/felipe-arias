What are the benefits of owning a home versus renting one? To answer that question, I’ll tell you about what was important to me when I first bought a home. To me, **it was important to know that my rent wasn’t going to be raised every year.** I wanted to know that my monthly mortgage payments and living costs were stable.&nbsp;

Buying a home also meant the freedom to upgrade it according to my tastes without having to worry about being kicked out. Financially speaking, buying a home is a great investment. In the long run, it will appreciate in value. There are also many tax benefits to take advantage of—you’re able to deduct all the interest you pay on your loans *and* your property taxes.

Overall, owning is a much better choice than renting. If you have any more questions about this or any other real estate topic, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.&nbsp;
