Here are six major issues that could sabotage your home sale:

**1\. Check with your title company to make sure there are no liens on your property.** A lien could be related to a past owner, judgements, or city violations that will need to be addressed. This can delay a sale for months if it’s not handled properly.

**2\. Check the roof.** This is an important system to look at, as is your foundation. These will affect your value and can sabotage your sale down the road.

**3\. Check the listing accuracy.** A lot of times, agents put in the wrong information online. It could just be a typo, but it happens. I run into a lot of cases where the wrong square footage, the Mello-Roos tax, or the HOA fees are a bit off. This is another thing that can delay your transaction.

**4\. Check with the HOA.** You want to make sure there are no special assessments coming up in the future that could affect your bottom line by hundreds of dollars.

**5\. Make sure you know what is staying and going.** You don’t want to have to fight over a refrigerator, solar energy system, or mounted TV.&nbsp;

The more proactive you are with all of these issues, the smoother your transaction will be. If you have any questions for me in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email today. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
