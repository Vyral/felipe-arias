**With all the fires, earthquakes, and other hazards that come along with living in California, it’s important to be properly insured.** To begin, you need to be sure you have the right insurance broker guiding you through the process.&nbsp;

Many variables are involved in the process, but the most crucial is the coverage you have. Is the amount they’re covering enough to build you a brand-new house if a disaster strikes? What is the deductible? Does your insurance include earthquake coverage? Likely, it doesn’t. The first thing to know is exactly how you’re insured.&nbsp;

If you need a referral for a reliable insurance broker, I can help you with that. Also, if you have any questions about real estate, please reach out to me via phone or email. I would be happy to help you.
