I’m humbled to announce my nomination for the candidacy for “Man of the Year” for the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society. I began 2019 with the intention of getting more involved with my community, but little did I know that I’d be presented with this great opportunity. My campaign consists of a 10-week fundraising competition and each dollar counts as a vote towards my candidacy. The competition begins on March 22, 2019. To learn more about how you can join me in the fight against cancer, watch this short video.
