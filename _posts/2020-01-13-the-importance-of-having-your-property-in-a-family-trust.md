Nobody likes to go to court. If you have a family trust and a will in place, though, the inheritance of a property is all laid out and any legal conflicts are avoided and your identity is protected. Rather than having a property under your name, which is a public record, you can have it under a family trust or any other name, really. **I recommend putting your property in a family trust** and having a will in place because you will avoid a lot of headaches. If you have any questions about having your property in a family trust, reach out to me by phone or email. I would love to help you.
