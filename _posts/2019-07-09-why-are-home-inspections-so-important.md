**When you’re buying a home, no matter what type of property is, you need to have a home inspection done on it**. We always recommend one to our clients. A general inspection ranges in cost from $200 to $500 and the inspector will do a thorough inspection of everything inside and outside of the property. You might just come across minor imperfections, but you might come across some serious issues as well.

**If you do find something serious, it can usually be negotiated,** either by a request for repairs, a credit toward closing costs, or a reduction on price. I like to call this the second round of negotiations after you open escrow.

Your inspection report will go into great detail and if there’s an issue that the inspector doesn’t quite fully have a grasp on, they’ll refer you to a specialist in that area.

**Make sure your inspector is bonded, licensed and insured.** If you need any recommendations from us, feel free to reach out.

If you have any questions for me about home inspections or about anything else related to real estate, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>&nbsp;
