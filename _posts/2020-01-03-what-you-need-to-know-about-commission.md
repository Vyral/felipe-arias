It’s common to hear people ask, “How much should I be paying my agent when listing my home?” My first response whenever I hear this question is to point out that it’s simply the wrong question.&nbsp;

You shouldn’t be focused on the agent’s commission—you should be focused on how much money you can get out of the sale of your home.&nbsp;

You need to ask yourself, “**What exactly is this agent going to do for me?** Are they knowledgeable and experienced? Are they the best in the area? What kind of marketing plan will they be using?”

At the core of it all, what should matter to you is that an agent is doing everything in their power to **sell your home for the most amount of money in the shortest period.&nbsp;**

Again, it’s all about asking yourself the right questions. Why should it matter if one agent charges 4% commission and another charges 6% if the real question is: Who could get you 10% more for the sale of your home?&nbsp;

I hope this perspective has been useful to you. If you have any further questions, feel free to reach out to me by phone or email. I’d be happy to help you in any way I can.&nbsp;
