Dear Friends,&nbsp;

By now you have probably heard that I am a candidate for The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society’s Man & Woman of the Year campaign. This is an honor that I do not take lightly, so I will be doing my best to raise as much money as I can for this important organization over the next 10 weeks.

With that said, I have been challenged to jumpstart my fundraising campaign by being the first candidate to receive 50 donations to The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society (LLS) starting right now. If I am the first to meet this challenge, I will earn an incentive to help raise more money! So I am writing to ask that you take action and support LLS today. Please use this link to donate online quickly and securely. &nbsp; Donations are 100% tax deductible: **[https://pages.mwoy.org/sd/sd19/farias](https://pages.mwoy.org/sd/sd19/farias){: target="_blank"}**

Each donation you make helps accelerate finding a cure for leukemia, lymphoma and myeloma. More than a million Americans are battling these blood cancers, and I hope that my candidacy will help bring them hope and support. For example, one of the key ways that LLS researchers are studying treatments is through targeted therapies—therapies that attack the cancer cells rather than other healthy cells in the body. Watch the video below to learn more about how your donation can benefit this important work:<br>&nbsp;<br>**[Hear From the LLS Researchers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_jIyFxyshE&amp;feature=player_embedded){: target="_blank"}**

Every donation truly brings us one step closer to a cure, which means even more to me than winning this challenge, or the Man of the Year title.&nbsp;

On behalf of The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, thank you very much for your gift. &nbsp;I appreciate your generosity.

Sincerely,

Felipe Arias
