People tend to think that the spring and summer seasons are the busiest times of the year for home sellers, causing them to ask if it’s a good idea to even try to sell their homes in the wintertime.

In San Diego, if you sell your home in the fourth quarter, **you’ll have much less competition** than you would if you sold in the spring. Because they think that the spring is a better time to sell, home sellers pull their homes off the market during the winter months or simply choose to wait until spring to list. That means there are fewer sellers in the winter to compete with for potential buyers’ attention.

And, while it’s true that there are also fewer buyers in the winter, that’s not necessarily a bad thing for sellers, either. **The buyers who are on the market in the fourth quarter tend to be more serious about purchasing a home.** You won’t have to worry as much about looky-loos who are just there to window-shop.

Additionally, **third-party services are generally more available in the winter** than in the other, busier seasons. Title companies, escrow companies, handymen, and contractors, for example, will be less preoccupied this time of the year, so they’ll be more readily available when you need them.
